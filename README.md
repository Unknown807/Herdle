# Wordle-Game
The Wordle Game written in Haskell, called Herdle, as part of my functional programming assignment

In Herdle, one word from a list of seven (one for each day of the week) is chosen as the word of the day. The user is given 6 attempts to guess the word. They can quit at any time.

When the user makes a guess, if a letter is used elsewhere in the word, the program will output '<' or '>' meaning before and after respectively. 'Y' is if the letter is in the correct place and '\_' is if the letter is not in the word at all.
